## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
There were few errors while running the IOS Simulator. The screen kept turning black.
Screen turned white becasue there were dublicate outlest.
When I changed the name of the outlets I had to manually delete the previous outlet. I didn't know about this.
Converting the Double value for tip to an Integer. Although it wasn't hard, it took some time to work it.
Updating the Split Amount and Total in real time while adusting the slider for Tip and Split.
